The ERS GPS unit connects to a RadioMaster ELRS receiver. Telemetry data is logged in a CSV file.

This script plots the flight path on to google maps. Signal strength is plotted with colours green being strong, orange being medium, red being weak. You must create a config.php and define the GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY in it for this script to work.
